Hello Humans!

Antonio, aka codebytes-ai, is here to tell you a little about my journey with tech. I've grown up with tech all my life and always found it fascinating seeing its progression throughout the years. I have a passion to be on the frontier of technology. I will be dedicating most of my time here to learning and contributing to collaborative work around AI technologies. I'll see you around my fellow techies.
